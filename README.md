## Puzzle4x4
This is a sliding puzzle game where the goal is to make a complete image.  
The user may move one tile at a time by trading places with an adjacent tile until each tile is in the correct place.
But be careful not to get cornered with one piece on the wrong side!
Guaranteed to be a lot of fun and to encourage creative and logical thinking. :)
